<h2 class="nocount">Status of this Document</h2>

<p>This is the 14-Jan-2014 version of the install instructions for
areaDetector.</p>
<p>
This version has a complete description of installing everything
required to build areaDetector on Linux.
However section 7 (Installition Details) is not written.
</p>
<p>
The instructions should also work for Darwin, i. e. macOS.
</p>
<p>
What remains is to describe how to build the GUI plugin configuration
tools, i,e. MEDM, EDM, CSS, and pvPy.
</p>
<p>So far no instructions are available for building
for windows, vxWorks, or RTEMS.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a guide for installing and building the areaDetector.
This guide is only valid for releases 2.0 and later of areaDetector.
This guide is intended for both areaDetector users and developers.
areaDetector can be obtained as a release or by cloning from the github
repository.
This guide provides instructions for installing and building on
linux. The guidelines should also work for darwin, i. e. macOS.
At this time there are no guidelines for windows, vxWorks, or RTEMS.
</p>
<p>The build process attempts to make the build process easy for typical cases but
allow site specific overrides.
areaDetector uses many other products:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>External Products</dt>
     <dd>TIFF, ZLIB, JPEG, SZIP, and HDF5 are all required.
        GRAPHICSMAGIC is optional.
        These are described in a later section.</dd>
   <dt>iocCore</dt>
     <dd>Any relatively recent 3.14 release of iocCore should work.</dd>
   <dt>EPICS modules</dt>
      <dd>asynDriver is required.
       Some synApps components are required, in particular CALC,
        BUSY, SSCAN, and AUTOSAVE.
        These are discussed in a later section.
       </dd>
    <dt>Configuration Products</dt>
      <dd>A configuration tool is required for configuration of areaDetector
       plugins. ADCORE has support for the following tools:
       MEDM, EDM, CSS, and pyQt.
        These are discussed in a later section.
       </dd>
    <dt>Image Viewer Products</dt>
       <dd>One or more of the following GUI tool are desirable for
        viewing image files: ImageJ, HDFView, and IDL.
</dl>
<p>
After all the required products have been installed
and a release of areaDetector has been downloaded
then do the following in the top level directory:
</p>
<dl>
   <dt>Copy files:</dt>
      <dd>
        <pre>
cp EXAMPLE_RELEASE_PATHS.local RELEASE_PATHS.local
cp EXAMPLE_RELEASE_LIBS.local RELEASE_LIBS.local
cp EXAMPLE_RELEASE_PRODS.local RELEASE_PRODS.local
        </pre>
   <dt>Edit RELEASE_PATHS.local</dt>
     <dd>
     The definitions for SUPPORT, AREA_DETECTOR, and EPICS_BASE must
     all be changed. All definitions must include the full path name.
     The definitions for HDF5 and SZ may need to be changed.
      If GRAPHICS_MAGIC is installed then the definitions for it
     may also need to be changed.
     </dd>
   <dt>Edit RELEASE_LIBS.local</dt>
     <dd>The location of ASYN must be specified with a full path name.
       If You have built the version that appears no changes are necessary.
     </dd>
   <dt>Edit RELEASE_PRODS.local</dt>
      <dd>The definitions for CALC, BUSY, SSCAN, and AUTOSAVE must
      have a full path name. If You have built the versions that appear
      no changes are necessary.</dd>
   <dt>make</dt>
    <dd>Just type:
      <pre>
make
      </pre>
       If this fails then some required products has probably not been
       installed. Read more of this manual and install what is missing.
       When areaDetector builds successfully go to the next step.
     </dd>
    <dt>Run SimDetector</dt>
     <dd>
        <pre>
cd ADCore/iocs/simDetectorIOC/iocBoot/iocSimDetector
make
cp envPaths envPaths.linux
 ../../bin/linux-x86_64/simDetectorApp st.cmd.linux
       </pre>
       If this works successfully then go to next step.
     </dd>
    <dt>Congradulations!!!</dt>
       <dd>You can ignore the rest of this document.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>NOTE MARK</b>
I suggest the following changes for EXAMPLE_RELEASE_PATHS.local:
<dl>
   <dt>XXX_DIR</dt>
      <dd>Change this to <b>XXX_LIB</b>.
        This requires a change in ADApp/commonDriverMakefile.
       </dd>
   <dt>XX_INCLUDES= -I</dt>
      <dd>Change this to <b>XX_INCLUDE=</b>.
         This requires a change in ADApp/pluginSrc/Makefile.
      </dd>
   <dt>Change statement order</dt>
     <dd>
       Put related things together.
     </dd>
    <dt>ZLIB, TIFF, and JPEG</dt>
      <dd>What about these? Should they also appear in RELEASE_PATHS.local
         OR maybe they should not appear and SZLIB should also not appear.
         Note that HDF5 and GRAPHICS_MAGICK MUST appear since they do
         not follow normal rules for /usr/local.
       </dd>
</dl>
Thus the EXAMPLE_RELEASE_PATHS.local becomes:
<pre>
# The following 3 definitions must be changed for each site
SUPPORT=/home/install/epics/support
AREA_DETECTOR=/home/git/areaDetector
EPICS_BASE=${SUPPORT}/base-3.14.12.3

# Define the location of HDF5
HDF5=/usr/local/hdf5
HDF5_LIB=${HDF5}/lib
HDF5_INCLUDE=${HDF5}/include

# Define the location of Graphics Magic
GRAPHICS_MAGICK=/usr/local
GRAPHICS_MAGICK_LIB=${GRAPHICS_MAGICK}/lib
GRAPHICS_MAGICK_INCLUDE=${GRAPHICS_MAGICK}/include/GraphicsMagick

#MARK either remove SZLIB or also have defs for TIFF, JPEB, and ZLIB
# Define the location of SZLIB
SZLIB=/usr/local
SZ_LIB=${SZLIB}/lib
SZ_INCLUDE=${SZLIB}/include

#Define TIFF, JPEG, and ZLIB ???
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Downloading a release of areaDetector</h2>
<h3>From github</h3>
<p>This requires that you have signed on to github and have generated an ssh key
and put it in git hub.
To sign on to github go to:
<a href="https://github.com/join">
Join github
</a>
This site also gives instructions for installing git.
The instructions for generating an ssh key are:
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">
ssh-key
</a>
</p>
<p>To download areaDetector via git just execute:</p>
<pre>
git clone --recursive git@github.com:areaDetector/areaDetector.git
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Release Site</h3>
<p>See
<a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/areaDetector.html">
areaDetector
</a>
</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> no 2.0 release of areaDetector is currently available.
Thus the only want to get it is through github.
</p>
<h2>External Products Required for Building areaDetector</h2>
<p>The product descrbes in this section are not part of epics (base, modules, or extensions)
but are used by areaDetector plugins.
Some may already be installed or your system so before reading this section just try to
build areaDetector, especially ADCore. If it builds this section can be ignored.
If it does not then this section can be used to locate and install any missing components.</p>
<p>
The instructions in this section were the result of installing all the components
on a new laptop on which I installed fedora 20.
Before installing I had already built iocCore, asynDriver, and the required synApps components.
</p>
<p>For each product the source was downloaded from a product download site and then
built. It may be easier to download pre-built modules, but downloading the sources and
building should work on more varieties of linux and darwin.</p>
<p>Each site provides some combination of .zip, .tar, .tar.gz, etc.
If the file is a zip file then just execute:
<pre>
unzip file.zip
</pre>
If the file is any flavor of tar just execute:
<pre>
tar xf file
</pre>
</p>
<p>All of the following products put the result of unzip or tar into a sub-directory.
cd to that directory and follow the instructions for the appropriate sub-section.
</p>
<p>
If the instructions in the following subsections are used then RELEASE_PATHS.local,
except for the first three definitions,
should be:
<pre>
# The following 3 definitions must be changed for each site

SUPPORT=/home/install/epics/support
AREA_DETECTOR=/home/git/areaDetector
EPICS_BASE=${SUPPORT}/base-3.14.12.3

# Define the location of HDF5
HDF5=/usr/local/hdf5
HDF5_DIR=${HDF5}/lib
HDF5_INCLUDES= -I${HDF5}/include

# Define the location of SZLIB
SZLIB=/usr/local
SZ_DIR=${SZLIB}/lib
SZ_INCLUDES= -I${SZLIB}/include

# Define the location of Graphics Magic
GRAPHICS_MAGICK=/usr/local
GRAPHICS_MAGICK_DIR=${GRAPHICS_MAGICK}/lib
GRAPHICS_MAGICK_INCLUDES= -I${GRAPHICS_MAGICK}/include/GraphicsMagick
</pre>
</p>
<h3>TIFF</h3>
  <p>This can be download from
<a href="http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff">
libTIFF
</a></p>
<p>Then click on the Master Download Site and download the latest stable release.</p>
<p>After the latest release is unziped cd to the release and execute the commands:</p>
<pre>
./configure
make
sudo make install
</pre>
<p>The include and library files are installed by default into <b>/usr/local</b>
<h3>ZLIB</h3>
  <p>This can be download from
<a href="http://www.zlib.net"</a>
zlib
</a></p>
<p>Then look for latest release download.</p>
<p>After untaring the release</p>
<pre>
./configure
make
sudo make install
</pre>
<p>The include and library files are installed by default into <b>/usr/local</b>
<h3>JPEG</h3>
  <p>This can be download from
<a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/general/libjpeg.html">
libjpeg
</a></p>
<p>
Read the instructions from the web site about installing.
I suggest that it be installed into <b>/usr/local</b> instead of
<b>/usr</b>.
Thus to install:</p>
<pre>
./configure --prefix=/usr/local  \
     --mandir=/usr/share/man \
     --with-jpeg8  \
     --disable-static \
     &amp;&amp; \
    sed -i -e '/^docdir/ s/$/\/libjpeg-turbo-1.3.0/'   \
     -e '/^exampledir/ s/$/\/libjpeg-turbo-1.3.0/' Makefile &amp;&amp;
make
make test
sodo make install
</pre>
<h3>SZIP</h3>
  <p>This can be download from
<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP">
SZIP
</a></p>
<p>Then click on <b>SZIP Source</b> and download the release that appears.</p>
<p>After the latest release is untared, cd to the release and execute the commands:</p>
<pre>
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
make check
sudo make install
</pre>
<h3>HDF5</h3>
<p>Start at:
<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">
HDF Group
</a></p>
<p>The click on Downloads, then Current Release, then HDF5 Software,
then Source Code, then latest release.</p>
<p>After the latest release is untared, cd to the release and
execute that command:</p>
<pre>
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5 
make
make check   
sudo make install
make check-install
</pre>
<h3>GRAPHICSMAGICK</h3>
<p>To build this from mercurial repository:</p>
<pre>
hg clone http://hg.code.sf.net/p/graphicsmagick/code graphicsmagick-code
cd graphicsmagick-code/
./configure
make
sudo make install
</pre>
<p>However when I tried to build areaDetector with GrahicsMagick
enabled the build failed with:</p>
<pre>
...
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib/libGraphicsMagick++.a(Image.o):
relocation R_X86_64_32S against `_ZTVN6Magick5ImageE'
can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
/usr/local/lib/libGraphicsMagick++.a: could not read symbols: Bad value
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
</pre>
<h2>EPICS Products Required for Building areaDetector</h2>
<p>areaDetector is based on
<a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/">
asyn
</a>
which is based on
<a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/base/index.php">
EPICS base
</a>
and also uses several
components from
<a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps">
synApps.
</a>
<p>The normal way of installing the EPICS components is to install
and build ASYN and all synApp components
under a single directory located by <b>SUPPORT</b>
in file <b>RELEASE_PATHS.local</b>.
All definitions in this file must have full path names.
</p>
<p>The expected version of ASYN appears in file
<b>RELEASE_LIBS.local</b>
If You want a different version then this file must be edited.
</p>
<p>The required synApps components appear is file
<b>RELEASE_PRODS.local</b>.
This file also shows which version of each component is expected.
If You want a different version then this file must be edited.
</p>
<h2>Configuration Products</h2>
<p>In order to configure the plugins You must install one or more of
the following: MEDM, EDM, CSS, pyQT.</p>
<h3>MEDM</h3>
<p>At present X11 is not avaliable for fedora 20.
Thus I can not build MEDM.</p>
<h3>EDM</h3>
<p>At present X11 is not avaliable for fedora 20.
Thus I can not build EDM.</p>
<h3>CSS</h3>
<h3>pyQt</h3>
<h2>Image Viewer Products</h2>
<h3>ImageJ</h3>
<h3>IDL</h3>

<h2>Installation Details</h2>
<h3>RELEASE_PATHS.local</h3>
<h3>RELEASE_LIBS.local</h3>
<h3>RELEASE_PRODS.local</h3>
