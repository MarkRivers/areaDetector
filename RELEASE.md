Release Notes
=============

Each submodule contains detailed release notes for each release of that submodule.  The release notes below
only provide a short summary of the most significant items from the submodules.

R2-0
----
* Moved the repository to [Github](https://github.com/areaDetector/areaDetector).
* Re-organized the directory structure to separate the driver libraries from the example IOC applications.
* Added new detector drivers:
    - ADLightField:  Driver for newer Princeton Instruments detectors using their LightField program
    - ADPixirad: Driver for CdTe pixel array detectors from Pixirad
    - ADPointGrey: Driver for Firewire, USB, and GigE cameras from Point Grey
* ADmarCCD driver: Added support for triggered and timed acquisition modes on the new high-speed (-HS) series
  of detectors.
* ADProsilica driver: Added support for conversion from raw Bayer to RGB1, RGB2, and RGB3 in the driver. 
  In areaDetector releases prior to R2-0 this could be done in the NDPluginColorConvert plugin.  
  That capability has been removed from the plugin to make the plugin independent of the AVT PvApi library.

TO DO BEFORE R2-0 RELEASE
=========================
* Get PointGrey driver working on GigE
* Finish PointGrey documentation
